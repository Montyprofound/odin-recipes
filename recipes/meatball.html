<li>⅛ teaspoon black pepper (or to taste)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons milk (if needed, for moisture)</li>
</ul>
<h3>For the sauce</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt (or to taste)</li>
    <li> teaspoon black pepper (or to taste)</li>
    <li>>Pinch of sugar (optional, to balance acidity)</li>
</ul>
<h3>For the sandwich</h3>
<ul>
    <li>4 hoagie rolls or sub rolls</li>
    <li>4-8 slices of mozzarella, provolone, or Italian blend cheese</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened (optional, for toasting)</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced (optional, for garlic butter)</li>
</ul>    
<h2>Steps of preparation</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Make the Meatballs:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>In a small bowl, soak the breadcrumbs in milk (if using) for a few minutes until softened.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, soaked breadcrumbs (squeeze out excess milk if very wet), Parmesan cheese, beaten egg, minced garlic, chopped parsley, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Gently mix all the ingredients with your hands until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the meatballs tough. If the mixture seems dry, add a tablespoon of milk.</li>
        <li>Shape the mixture into 1 ½ to 2-inch meatballs. You should get about 12-16 meatballs.</li>
        <li>Place the meatballs on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Baking Method:</strong> Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F). Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the meatballs are browned and cooked through.</li>
      </ul>
    </li><br>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>While the meatballs are baking (or in a separate skillet if pan-frying), heat olive oil in a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant, being careful not to burn it.</li>
        <li>Pour in the crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt, pepper, and sugar (if using). Bring the sauce to a simmer.</li>
         <li>If you baked the meatballs, gently add them to the simmering sauce. If you pan-fried them, drain any excess grease and then add them to the sauce.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for at least 15-20 minutes, allowing the meatballs to fully cook (if not already) and the flavors to meld. Stir occasionally.</li>
      </ul>
    </li><br>
    <li><strong>Assemble the Sandwiches:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Rolls (Optional):</strong> If desired, slice the hoagie rolls lengthwise, being careful not to cut all the way through. In a small bowl, mix the softened butter with minced garlic (if using). Spread the garlic butter (or plain butter) on the inside of the rolls. You can lightly toast the buttered rolls under a broiler for 1-2 minutes until golden brown, watching carefully to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Spoon a generous amount of the meatball and sauce mixture into each roll.</li>
        <li>Top with slices of mozzarella, provolone, or your preferred cheese.</li>
        <li>Place the assembled sandwiches on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li><strong>Melt the Cheese:</strong> Place the baking sheet under a preheated broiler for 1-3 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Watch closely to prevent burning.</li>
      </ul>
    </li><br>
    <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Carefully remove the meatball sandwiches from the broiler and serve immediately.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
